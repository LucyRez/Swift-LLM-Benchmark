" Here is a simple implementation of this in Swift using the `sorted(by:)` method available on arrays, which sorts an array based on a comparison closure provided as argument to it. 

```swift
struct User {
    var firstName: String
    var lastName: String
}

func sortUsersByLastName(_ users: [User]) -> [User] {
    return users.sorted(by: { $0.lastName < $1.lastName })
}
```
In this code, `$0` and `$1` are shorthand for the first and second items being compared in a closure passed to `sorted(by:)` respectively. This closure compares two users by their last names using Swift's less-than operator (`<`). The function returns a new array where the entities are sorted by their lastName property in ascending order.
  
You can use this function like so:
```swift
let users = [User(firstName: ""John"", lastName: ""Doe""), User(firstName: ""Jane"", lastName: ""Smith"")]
let sortedUsers = sortUsersByLastName(users)
print(sortedUsers)  // prints ""[User(firstName: ""Jane"", lastName: ""Smith""), User(firstName: ""John"", lastName: ""Doe"")]""
```",8.622537515294084
" Here is your Swift code snippet:

```swift
func reverseArray(array: [Int]) -> [Int] {
    return Array(array.reversed())
}
```",8.495740424545366
" 1. Create a new Swift file.
   2. Define your function as follows, where `array` is the input integer array:
```swift
func filterOutEvenNumbers(from array: [Int]) -> [Int] {
     return array.filter { $0 % 2 != 0 }
}
```
3. This code uses Swift's built-in `filter` method, which creates a new array containing only elements for which the given closure returns true. Here, the closure checks if a number is odd by checking if the remainder when divided by 2 is not zero (i.e., if the number modulo 2 is not equal to 0).
   4. This function can be used as follows:
```swift
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
let oddNumbers = filterOutEvenNumbers(from: numbers)
print(oddNumbers) // Outputs ""[1, 3, 5]""
```
In this example, `filterOutEvenNumbers` is called with an array of integers. The function returns a new array containing only the odd numbers from the input array. This result is then printed to the console.",8.614188004781774
" Here is your swift solution:

```swift
func charFrequency(str: String) -> [Character: Int] {
    var freqDict = [Character: Int]()
    
    for char in str.unicodeScalars{
        if let count = freqDict[char]{
            freqDict[char] = count + 1
        } else {
            freqDict[char] = 1
        }
    }
    
    return freqDict
}
```
You can call this function with a string to get the frequency of each character in it. For example: 

`let result = charFrequency(str: ""Hello, World!"")`

This will give you the dictionary `result` containing the frequency count for each character present in the input string. 
Note that this function considers different languages and special characters as distinct characters. If you want to consider only lower-case letters, upper-case letters or digits (or any other set of characters), then modify the code accordingly. The provided solution is case sensitive and takes into account whitespaces too.",8.631933613833747
" Here is the requested function written in Swift:

    let formatter = DateFormatter()
    formatter.dateFormat = ""yyyy-MM-dd""

}
```
This function takes a `Date` object as input and returns the string representation of that date in the format `yyyy-MM-dd` using an instance of `DateFormatter`. 
Please note that you need to import Foundation library for this to work because DateFormatter is part of it. The ""import Foundation"" statement at the beginning makes all classes, structures, and enumerations from the Foundation framework available in your program.",8.628740338019986
" Below is the Swift code which you can use. This code uses Apple's built-in `URLSession` class to fetch data from a specified URL, then it decodes this data into a String using UTF8 encoding. 

```swift
import Foundation

func fetchUserData(urlString: String, completionHandler: @escaping (String) -> Void){
    guard let url = URL(string: urlString) else {
        print(""Invalid URL"")
        return
    }

        if let error = error { 
            print (""Error fetching data from server \(error)"") 
            return 
        }
      
        guard let httpStatus = response as? HTTPURLResponse, (200...299).contains(httpStatus.statusCode) else {            
            print (""Unsuccessful server response \(response)"") 
            return 
        }
        
        guard let data = data else { 
            print(""No Data Returned from Server"") 
            return 
        }
      
        // Convert the data to a string using UTF8 encoding.
        if let responseString = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8) {
            completionHandler(responseString)
        } else {
            print(""Unable to convert server's response to string"") 
        }
    }
    
    task.resume()
}
```
You can call this function and pass a URL as a String argument:

```swift
fetchUserData(urlString: ""https://www.example.com/userdata"", completionHandler: { (response) in 
        print(""Response from server:\n\(response)"") 
})
```
This code will fetch the data asynchronously, which means it won't block your app while waiting for a response. The `completionHandler` closure is called once the data has been successfully fetched and converted to a String. It allows you to handle the server response in another part of your program (like updating an interface).

Please replace ""https://www.example.com/userdata"" with your actual URL, as this example doesn't include real user data fetching from a server. 

This code assumes that the server sends JSON responses which you can easily parse to your own model objects using Swiftâ€™s `JSONDecoder` class or third-party libraries like SwiftyJSON.",8.228012682051231
" Here's how you can do it using Swift 4 and Alamofire, which is a popular networking library for iOS applications.

```swift
import Foundation
import Alamofire

func sendPostRequest(urlString: String, jsonPayload: [String: Any]) {
    let headers: HTTPHeaders = [""Content-Type"": ""application/json""]
    
    do {
        // Encode the JSON payload into a Data object.
        let jsonData = try JSONSerialization.data(withJSONObject: jsonPayload, options: .prettyPrinted)
        
        Alamofire.request(urlString, method: .post, parameters: nil, encoding: JSONEncoding(jsonData), headers: headers).responseString { response in
            switch response.result {
            case .success(let value):
                print(""Response String:\n\(value)"")
                
            case .failure(let error):
                print(""Request failed with error: \(error)"")
            }
        }
    } catch let error as NSError {
        print(""Failed to convert JSON payload into data. Error: \(error)"")
    }
}
```
This function sends a POST request using the provided URL string and JSON payload, then prints the response as a string. It first converts the JSON payload to `Data` format with `JSONSerialization`, and then uses Alamofire's `request(urlString:method:parameters:encoding:headers:)` method to send the request. The response from the server is returned in string form. 

This function can be used as follows:
```swift
let url = ""https://example.com/api""
let payload: [String: Any] = [""key"": ""value""]
sendPostRequest(urlString: url, jsonPayload: payload)
```
Note that you need to import and use Alamofire in your project for this code snippet to work properly. 

You can install it via Swift Package Manager or CocoaPods by adding the following dependency to your `Package.swift` file (Swift Package Manager):
```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: ""https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire.git"", from: ""4.8.2"")
]
```
Or add this line to your `Podfile` (CocoaPods):
```ruby
pod 'Alamofire'
```
Then run `pod install` in the Terminal and open your workspace instead of Xcode project for changes to take effect. 

Remember that you have to handle networking errors, network unavailability, etc., appropriately based on your application requirements. This is a basic example and does not include those aspects.",7.475737150323755
" Here is how you would write this function in Swift using URLSession and Swift Codable protocol:

```swift
import Foundation

struct Post: Codable {
    var id: Int
    var title: String
    // add other properties if needed
}

func fetchPosts(from url: URL, completion: @escaping ([Post]?) -> Void) {
    let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { (data, response, error) in
        if let data = data, error == nil {
            do {
                let posts = try JSONDecoder().decode([Post].self, from: data)
                completion(posts)
            } catch {
                print(""Error decoding json \(error)"")
                completion(nil)
            }
        } else if error != nil {
            print(""Error fetching posts \(error?.localizedDescription ?? ""Unknown Error"")"")
            completion(nil)
        }
    }
    task.resume()
}
```

You can call the function like this:

```swift
let url = URL(string: ""http://example.com/posts"")  // replace with your URL
fetchPosts(from: url) { posts in
    if let posts = posts {
        for post in posts {
            print(""ID: \(post.id), Title: \(post.title)"")  
            // add other properties to print here
        }
    } else {
        print(""Failed to fetch posts"")
    }
}
```

Make sure the URL is accessible and returns valid JSON data that matches your `Post` struct. If it does not, an error will be printed in the console.",7.718851735637665
" Here's some sample code using Swift 3 and SwiftURLSession in combination with Alamofire to fetch images from remote url. You should install Alamofire via CocoaPods or Carthage first.

```swift
import UIKit
import Alamofire

func updateImageViewWithUrl(_ imageView: UIImageView, _ urlString: String) {
    // Fetch Image From URL
    AF.request(urlString).responseData { response in
        if let data = response.data {
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                // Update ImageView with Downloaded Data
                imageView.image = UIImage(data: data)
            }
        } else {
           print(""Error while fetching the image"")
        }
    }
}
```
In this code, `updateImageViewWithUrl(_:_:)` is a function that accepts an instance of `UIImageView` and a string representing a URL. It uses Alamofire to fetch data from the given URL, then creates a new UIImage using the downloaded data. The newly created image is then set on the provided ImageView within the main thread (to avoid any UI threading issues). 

Please note that this code assumes you have already added Alamofire and SwiftURLSession to your project in Xcode via CocoaPods or Carthage, as they're not included with Swift. If you haven't done so yet, please follow the instructions on the Alamofire website.

Also note that fetching large images could potentially cause memory issues or slow down your application due to the amount of data being transferred over the network. Consider loading smaller versions of these images and then scaling them up as needed for display in your UIImageView if necessary.",7.76287653526205
" Here is your solution in Swift:

```swift
import Foundation

struct Weather {
    let temp: Double
}

func fetchWeatherData(from urlString: String) {
    guard let url = URL(string: urlString) else { return }
    
    let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { (data, response, error) in
        do {
            if let data = data {
                let weatherData = try JSONDecoder().decode(Weather.self, from: data)
                print(""Temperature is \(weatherData.temp)"")

                print(""No data returned"")

            print(""Error decoding json: \(error.localizedDescription)"")
        }
    }
    
    task.resume()
}
```
In the code above, we define a `Weather` struct that matches the JSON structure from your URL. The function `fetchWeatherData(from:)` fetches data from the given URL using URLSession and then decodes it into a Weather object with JSONDecoder. If successful, it prints out the temperature; otherwise, it provides error messages.
Please make sure to replace ""urlString"" with your actual URL string when you call this function. 
This code assumes that the response from your API is in JSON format and contains an attribute named 'temp' which holds the temperature value. If not, you will need a more complex data model or update the JSONDecoder accordingly.",7.707609930184514

In this code:
- We use the `@State` property wrapper to create a state variable that will be observed for changes. 
- The slider's value is bound with the `value` state variable using the `$` operator in the SwiftUI view hierarchy. This means any change to the value of the slider will automatically update the `value` variable and cause the view to be rerendered.
- We use a text label inside a vertical stack (VStack) that displays the current value. The Text view is updated whenever the state changes thanks to SwiftUI's automatic binding feature. 
- We set up an initial slider value of `50` in our ContentView struct and a range between `0` to `100` for the Slider.

This SwiftUI code creates a View with a Toggle switch in the top that changes its state (on or off). Depending on the current state of the toggle, it either sets the background color to green when `isOn` is true and red when `isOn` is false. It also has a Spacer view to take up all available space. When `isOn` is true, this spacer's background color changes to green; otherwise, it remains red.

This code does not actually change the background of the entire View but only the part where we have applied the background property. If you want to change the whole view color when the toggle switch changes state, then you might need to create a separate view with different colors and use the `isOn` variable to conditionally show one or another:

The gradient starts from blue and ends at green. A ZStack is used here to layer two circles on top of each other, one for the empty circle and another for the progress bar that fills based on the provided percentage. The `rotationEffect` modifier is used to rotate the second circle to fill up the space as per the progress value.

}
```
In this code, `@State` is used to create a variable that can be observed by SwiftUI for changes. The `TextField` view takes the text from and puts the password into the `password` state variable. We use the toggle button's action to change the secure entry setting on tap. When it's true, we show an ""eye"" icon which implies that the password is shown, otherwise - a filled-in eye icon, implying that the text field contains hidden password data.

Please note that `textContentType` and `keyboardType` are used to give more context to the TextField for accessibility purposes in iOS 14+. The `TextField` has been set to `newPassword` type so that it appropriately displays a keyboard with symbols and numbers, as per best security practices.",7.381466845923336
" Here is some sample swift code that utilizes MapKit and SwiftUI to show a map with a specific location:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import MapKit

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        MapView(coordinateRegion: .init(center: CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 37.5665, longitude: 126.978), span: MKCoordinateSpan(latitudeDelta: 0.01, longitudeDelta: 0.01)))
    }
}

struct MapView: UIViewRepresentable {
    
    let coordinateRegion: MKCoordinateRegion
    
    func makeUIView(context: Context) -> MKMapView {
        return MKMapView()
    }
    
    func updateUIView(_ mapView: MKMapView, context: Context) {
        mapView.setRegion(coordinateRegion, animated: true)
    }
}
```
This code creates a SwiftUI View with an embedded `MKMapView` that is centered on the specific location (37.5665Â° N, 126.978Â° E). The region span defines how zoomed in or out the map view will be when it first appears.
The `ContentView` and `MapView` are structs defined to meet SwiftUI's requirement of views being a combination of other views (in this case, `MKMapView`) and stateful values.

Please replace the latitude and longitude value in the code with your specific location's coordinates. 

Remember to add the necessary permissions for accessing user's location in Info.plist file:
```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to determine your current location so we can show you nearby attractions and activities.</string>
```
Also, please note that this code needs a physical device or simulator because MapKit requires the use of UIViewRepresentable which is not available on macOS or watchOS emulators.",6.864833948699457
" Here is your requested SwiftUI code. It uses the `scaleEffect` modifier which causes the view to scale by the specified factor, in this case 0.9. The `onTapGesture` modifier makes the button respond to tap gestures.

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var isPressed = false
    
    var body: some View {
        Button(action: {
            withAnimation {
                self.isPressed.toggle()
            }
        }) {
            Text(""Tap me"")
                .scaleEffect(isPressed ? 0.9 : 1)
        }
        .onTapGesture {
            isPressed = true
        }
    }
}
```
In this code, the `Button` has an action that toggles a state variable called `isPressed` when it's tapped. This changes the scale of the button so that it scales down when pressed and then back up when released (because we use animation). The `onTapGesture` modifier is used to start the press-down action immediately when the button is tapped, rather than waiting for the tap gesture to end.

This code can be placed in a SwiftUI view file within an iOS application. Make sure that you have imported the necessary modules at the top of your file (`import SwiftUI`) and ensure this code is part of the `body` property of a struct conforming to `View` protocol.",6.651127238767948
" Here is how you can do this using SwiftUI:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var backgroundColor = Color.red
    
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(backgroundColor)
            .frame(width: 100, height: 100)
            .onTapGesture {
                withAnimation(.easeInOut(duration: 2.0)) {
                    if backgroundColor == Color.red {
                        self.backgroundColor = Color.blue
                    } else {
                        self.backgroundColor = Color.red
                    }
                }
            }
    }
}
```
This code creates a circle that fills the view with color red (`Color.red`). When tapped, it changes the color of the circle to blue for two seconds (`withAnimation(.easeInOut(duration: 2.0))`), and then back to red again. The `onTapGesture` modifier is used to handle tap events on this view.
You can use any other colors as per your requirement. Also, you can change the duration of color transition by changing the value in `duration: 2.0` property.",6.519061050125154
" 
```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var offset = 0.0 // Track position of the view
    
    var body: some View {
        ZStack{
            Text(""Tap to move"")
                .position(x: self.offset, y: 150)   // Set initial position
                .onTapGesture {                      // When tapped...
                    withAnimation(.easeInOut(duration: 2)) {    // ...animate the movement of the view...
                        self.offset = (self.offset == 200 ? 0 : 200)   // ...and move it across the screen
                    }
                }
        }
    }
}
```
This code will create a text label that moves horizontally across the screen when tapped. The animation will take 2 seconds, and the movement will be smooth due to .easeInOut modifier on withAnimation closure. The view's initial position is set at x:0, y:150 coordinates of the ZStack (in this case, it is in the middle), moving leftwards when tapped once and moving rightwards when tapped again.
The code will automatically adjust the movement direction based on whether the label has already moved past 200 points to the left or right from its initial position.",6.597791081249258
" Here is the SwiftUI code for a rectangle that rotates 360 degrees when tapped. This example assumes you have imported SwiftUI and are using Xcode 12 or later:
```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var rotationAngle = 0.0
    
    var body: some View {
        Rectangle()
            .fill(Color.blue)
            .rotationEffect(.degrees(rotationAngle))
            .onTapGesture {
                withAnimation {
                    self.rotationAngle += 360
                }
            }
    }
}
```
This code defines a rectangle that is filled with blue color and rotates by the amount specified in `rotationAngle` degrees whenever it's tapped. The rotation angle is increased by 360 degrees (a full circle) during each tap gesture, causing the rectangle to rotate through its entire 360 degree arc when tapped.

Please note that you need Xcode 12 or later version and SwiftUI framework for running this code. Also, remember that animations in SwiftUI work by default only if your app is running on a device (not the Simulator). To see animation effect on simulator please add `#if !targetEnvironment(simulator)` before your animation block.
```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var rotationAngle = 0.0
    
    var body: some View {
        Rectangle()

    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}
```
This SwiftUI code includes a button that toggles the `showLabel` state. When this state changes, the label is animated to slide in or out. Note that you need to import SwiftUI at the beginning of your file. 

The `withAnimation {}` block allows us to animate our view's change. This will cause any view inside the closure to smoothly transition between its old and new state over a period of time (controlled by animation settings). The `.transition(.slide)` modifier is applied on text label for slide effect when it appears/disappears from screen. 

Remember, SwiftUI previews are available in Xcode beta versions. If you want to see the preview of this code you must have a stable version of Xcode and iOS running at least iOS 13.0 or above as SwiftUI is only supported on these platforms.",6.357247147573536

}
```

This code creates a form with text fields for username, email and password. It also includes a picker to select gender from the list of genders provided (Male, Female & Other). The register button is there just as an example; you would replace this action with your own registration logic or function call.
Remember to import SwiftUI at the top of your file if it's not already imported in your project. 
The `@State` property wrapper for each text field ensures that their values are updated and used across different parts of the view hierarchy, keeping them consistent as user interacts with these fields. The Picker view uses a selection binding to keep track of which gender is currently selected by the user.",6.37754886987415

In the above SwiftUI code, we create a view `ProfileView` that contains an image of the user's profile, their name and email as text fields. Then there is a button which triggers logout logic when tapped. The button has red background color, white foreground color, corner radius 10 for styling purpose.
Remember to replace ""John Doe"" with your actual username and ""johndoe@example.com"" with the user's email address. Also, you need to replace ""user_profile"" with your actual image file name in your asset catalog.",6.247994572525196

Note: The `ColorPicker` struct is not provided in this code, it's a custom UI component for picking the color scheme. This code assumes you have some kind of way to set and get the user's preferred color scheme (light or dark mode).
In this example we are using @State variable to store the state of toggle and @Environment(\.colorScheme) to determine if it is in light or dark mode, so when changing the settings, SwiftUI can handle the UI updates automatically. 
For fetching app version information, we're using `Bundle.main.object(forInfoDictionaryKey: ""CFBundleShortVersionString"")` which returns the short version string of your bundle (usually in form of x.y.z).",6.252776293296709

This code creates a SwiftUI view with an array of strings (recent activities). The `VStack` is used to stack the elements vertically, the greeting message as a `Text` element, a list showing all recent activities and a ""Refresh"" button which triggers the `refreshData()` function.
The `List` displays each activity in its own horizontal row with an activity name inside it. The `Button` is used to trigger some action when pressed in this case it's refreshing the data, but you can replace it with whatever logic you want depending on your actual application scenario.

Please replace ""Your home screen content here..."", ""Your search tab content here..."" and ""Your profile tab content here..."" with your desired content for each tab. You can customize the appearance of tabs by modifying `tabItem` closure. The images are provided from Apple's system name catalogue.
